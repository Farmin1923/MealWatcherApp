	# MealWatcher_Apple

This app uses a file format mirroring Apple's Unified Logging System,
but is implemented to keep log in a file which can be viewed WITHOUT 
all other phone activity found in the Unified Logger.

Susbsystem tags relate to files, but to save memory and space, file names are abbreviated.
Here is a chart of all abbreviations.
